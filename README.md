Web-Based Sales Endpoint App
---------------------------

Overview
--------

The web-based sales endpoint app is a microservices-based application designed to create and manage sales endpoints for businesses. The application features user authentication, domain management, SSL certificate management, and customizable sales pages. The application will be built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies, such as React, Node.js, and MySQL.

Architecture
-----------

### Microservices Architecture

The application will be built using a microservices architecture, with each service responsible for a specific business capability, such as product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing, order management, and inventory management. Each service will be built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies.

### Domain Name Management

The management system will have the ability to create and manage multiple domain names for different brands and products. Each domain name will be associated with a specific set of services, such as a product catalog, shopping cart, and payment processing. The management system will have the ability to route traffic to the appropriate services based on the domain name of the incoming request.

### Application Deployment

The application will be deployed on a cloud platform, such as AWS or Azure. The application will be deployed using a containerization technology, such as Docker, to ensure consistency and portability across different environments. The management system will have the ability to scale individual services up or down based on demand.

### Database Management

The application will use a relational database management system, such as MySQL, to store product information, customer data, and order history. The management system will have the ability to create and manage database schemas for different brands and products. The management system will have the ability to perform database backups and restores.

### Security

The application will use HTTPS to secure communication between the client and server. The management system will have the ability to manage SSL certificates for each domain name. The application will use authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data.

### Monitoring and Logging

The management system will have the ability to monitor application performance, including metrics such as response time, error rates, and resource utilization. The management system will have the ability to view logs for each service, including error logs, access logs, and application logs.

### Backup and Disaster Recovery

The management system will have the ability to perform backups of the application data, including the database and file system. The management system will have the ability to restore the application data in case of a disaster.

### Unified Management System

The management system will have a user-friendly interface that allows administrators to manage all aspects of the application, including domain names, services, databases, and security. The management system will have the ability to create and manage user accounts for different brands and products. The management system will have the ability to set up workflows and approval processes for different business processes, such as product catalog management and order management.
